    <h1>UAE National Day Celebration</h1>
    <p>Today, our school was full of excitement because it was <span class="highlight">UAE National Day</span>. Keilah, Jhodie, Elle, and Caira wore traditional Emirati clothes and helped decorate the classrooms with green, white, black, and red flags.</p>
    <p>During the assembly, we all sang the national anthem together. Keilah and Jhodie performed a traditional dance, while Elle and Caira waved flags in the parade around the school. Our teachers shared stories about the UAE’s history and achievements, and everyone learned why this day is so special.</p>
    <p>By the end of the day, Keilah, Jhodie, Elle, and Caira smiled proudly, feeling happy to celebrate their country and its wonderful traditions.</p>
